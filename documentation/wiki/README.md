# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome

This website is a resource for internal Simpler.Grants.gov team members, external collaborators, and community members.

Under the Get Involved section, you'll find all the resources you need to participate in open-source development. We recommend starting here:

{% content-ref url="get-involved/get-involved.md" %}
[get-involved.md](get-involved/get-involved.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

The Product section is helpful in understanding how past development and process decisions were made and getting information on the work that is currently in development.
